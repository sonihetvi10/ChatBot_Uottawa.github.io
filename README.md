The assignment requires us to implement a basic chatbot using Google’s dialogflow tool. We took the
opportunity and created a chatbot which we think would be very helpful to its target audience. 

Topic: Frequent questions asked by the first-year newly admitted students at a university.
We took into consideration all the challenges we faced once we started studying in the university so we came
up with a topic which would help students with a similar situation as ours when they start studying themselves.


Our approach included the following steps:
Step 1: Come up with the competency questions.
Step 2: Create an ontology of our thoughts using Protege.
Step 3: Think about all the sub-sections involved with our competency questions.
Step 4: Set up Google Dialog Flow account.
Step 5: Create Intents for all the competency questions and sub questions.
Step 6: Come up with different test cases which involved multiple training questions and their answers.
Step 7: Implement the chatbot and test it thoroughly to find the edge cases.
Step 8: Figure out the weak spots of our implementation and areas of improvement.
Step 9: Add code for the chatbot on the web page to validate the final product.
